          <p className="py-2">
            After graduating with a degree of <i>Mechanical Engineering</i>, I
            decided to pursue my passion for programming. I started taking
            online courses in web and mobile development specifically{" "}
            <i>React</i>, <i>NextJs</i>, and <i>Flutter</i> frameworks.
          </p>
          <p className="py-2">
            I started my developer career in 2022 when I took an intership job
            at a startup company and built a mobile app using Flutter framework.
            This gave me an opportunity to gain development experience and show
            my skills and also experienced working in a team.
          </p>
          <p className="py-2">
            I continued improving my programming skills delving into backend development with Node.js and Flask.
            I've also started doing freelancing jobs as a full stack developer.
          </p>
          <p className="py-2">
            <i>When I'm not coding,</i> I enjoy playing video games, reading
            history, science, and philosphy books, drawing, and playing the
            guitar. And I also regularly go to the gym ðŸ’ª.
          </p>
          <p className="py-2">
            I am deeply committed to expanding my skills and knowledge and also
            actively seeking opportunities to delve deeper into more advanced
            concepts and frameworks.
