            After graduating with a degree of <i>Mechanical Engineering</i>, I
            decided to pursue my passion for programming. I started taking
            online courses in web and mobile development specifically{" "}
            <i>React</i>, <i>NextJs</i>, and <i>Flutter</i> frameworks.

            I started my front-end developer career in 2022 when I took an
            intership job at a startup company and built a mobile app using
            Flutter framework. This gave me an opportunity to gain development
            experience and show my skills and also{" "}
            <i>experienced working in a team.</i>

            <i>When I'm not coding,</i> I enjoy playing video games, reading
            history, science, and philosphy books, drawing, and playing the
            guitar. And I also regularly go to the gym ðŸ’ª (the picture on the

            I am currently looking for an entry level full-time position as a
            web developer. I am deeply committed to expanding my skills and
            knowledge and also actively seeking opportunities to delve deeper
            into more advanced concepts and frameworks.
